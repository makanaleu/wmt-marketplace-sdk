## Features

- **Orders**
  - **All Release Orders:** Retrieves all the orders with line items that are in the "created" status, that is, these orders have been released from the Walmart Order Management System to the seller for processing. The released orders are the orders that are ready for a seller to fulfill.
  - **Acknowledge Orders:** You can use this API to acknowledge an entire order, including all of its order lines. Walmart requires a seller to acknowledge orders within four hours of receipt of the order, except in extenuating circumstances.

## Roadmap

- **Orders**
  - We are working on completing the Orders methods.

## Usage

You only need to set your API credentials once in the process. They don't need to be
set for each call within the same process.

```javascript
import { WMT } from 'wmt-marketplace-sdk';

WMT.Request.Credentials = new WMT.Config.Credentials(
  '38b7eb6c-3672-4022-93a2-f47794f36338', // CHANNEL.TYPE
  'f091ae58-774c-45ff-9d8a-e30a83344e42', // Consumer ID
  'MIIBVgIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCAUAwggE8AgEAAkEAq7BFUpkGp3...' // Private Key
);
```

### Get All Released Orders

```javascript
WMT.Orders.getAllReleased({
  CreatedStartDate: new Date('01 April 2018 00:00 UTC'), // required
  CreatedEndDate: new Date('02 April 2018 00:00 UTC'), // optional, defaults to current time
  Limit: 10 // optional, defaults to 200 (max)
}).then((purchaseOrders: WMT.Orders.PurchaseOrder.PurchaseOrderResponse) => {
  // do something with the orders
});
```

### Acknowledge Orders

```javascript
WMT.Orders.ackOrder({
  PurchaseOrderId: 2380639477120
}). then((purchaseOrders: WMT.Orders.PurchaseOrder.PurchaseOrderResponse) => {
  // The response to a successful call contains the acknowledged order, which should
  // now reflect an "Acknowledge" status.
});
```
